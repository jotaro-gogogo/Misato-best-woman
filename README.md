### Hi! I'm a Mexican weeb developer. 🧑‍💻

**What I'm currently working on?** not much, besides studying CS I've coded my own website and am working on a little Pyhton app to store images and sidenotes into a database.  
I've got experience at Python, C, Java, Kotlin and frontend web development.  
I'm a *He* just so you know. 👍  
I speak Spanish as my mother tongue 🇲🇽, fluent English 🇺🇸 and just started learning Japanese 🇯🇵.

Feel free to ask me about anything [Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion)!
